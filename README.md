# blackjack_java_android_project
Create a simple implementation of Blackjack in Java

The purpose of this project was to consolidate my Java learning and apply some Android development to create a front end.

### The Brief

## Card game

Goal: Create a card game in Android.

We recommend something reasonably straight forward like BlackJack. The logic for your app will be in Java classes and you can use the methods in these classes in Android activites to create a UI.

HINT Think of the lessons where we wrote regular Java classes in Android Studio, ran unit tests on them, and then used them in our Eight Ball app.

# MVP

The game does not need to have much or any interaction. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic. For example, if you had two players being dealt two cards each your screen might look something like:

  Player 1: Ace of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds
  Player 2: 3 of Clubs, 2 of Hearts

  Player 1 Wins!
Project Extensions

Possibly add another card game
Improve the UI

----
I decided to take a staged approach here and created a simple high-card-wins game initially, with the goal in mind of creating a SOLID app that I could easily add new games to, such as Blackjack.

As I worked through the project I realised I would get a lot more out of the week if I shifted focus from the Android front end to the Java logic of creating a more complex game. As a result I have a set of game logic in Java but with no display or front end. However I learned a lot of interesting Java logic over the time and feel a lot more comfortable with it.
